## Exercise 3.1:

Create a memoize function that remembers previous inputs and stores them in cache so that it wonâ€™t have to compute the same inputs more than once. The function will take an unspecified number of integer inputs and a reducer method.(1.5hours)

*Guidelines*:

1. The memoize function should be written from scratch.

2. 3rd party libraries such as lodash or underscore should not have been used.

3. The function should carry a name which should denote the functionality of it.

4. The function should be able to take n number of arguments.

*Outcomes*:

1. Understanding how caching works.

2. Why is it important?

3. The problem memoization solves.
